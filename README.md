# World Population Data Analysis Project
The objective of this project is to answer logical questions about the world population by country.

There are two tables used to answer these questions: countries and population_years
Table countries has three columns (id (integer) as primary key, name (text) and continent (text))
Table population_years has four columns (id (integer) as primary key, population (number) in millions, year (number), country_id (integer) as foreign key)

The questions are :
1. How many records in the table 'countries' are from Africa? 
2. What was the total population of the continent of Oceania in 2005?
3. What is the average population of countires in South America in 2003?
4. What country had the smallest population in 2007?
5. What is the average population of Poland during the time period covered by this dataset?
6. How many countries have the word 'The' in their name?
7. What was the total population of each continent in 2010?

This project was completed using SQL in the SQLite.
